# lulz

`lulz` is a [LOLCODE](http://www.lolcode.org/) interpreter written in rust.

**It...**

- is based on the [**LOLCODE spec**](https://github.com/justinmeza/lolcode-spec)
- has **additional extensions** (`RANDOM`, `ARGV`, and more)
- **won't segfault** like [lci](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci) [does](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci/issues/49) [a](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci/issues/47) [lot](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci/issues/54)
- has **good rust/clang-like-errors**

Also, I ([@MonliH](https://github.com/MonliH)) will continue to merge PRs and address issues (unlike [lci](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci)!)
