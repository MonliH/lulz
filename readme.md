# lulz

`lulz` is a [LOLCODE](http://www.lolcode.org/) interpreter written in rust.

It...
* is based on the [LOLCODE spec](https://github.com/justinmeza/lolcode-spec)
* has additional extensions (`RANDOM`, `ARGV`, and more)
* has good rust/clang-like-errors
* won't segfault like [lci](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci) [does](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci/issues/49)
